Regular simulation that only takes into account R_0, death rate, and recovery 
time and counts the ticks until the virus dies out. 

INSTRUCTIONS: input the parameters as prompted. Note that the death rate is in 
raw percentage - i.e. if the death rate of the thing you're trying to model is 
4.5% then just input 4.5. If you choose to run the visualizer then close the 
visualizer window to proceed with the simulation. On my machine, 20000 
connections on 10000 nodes runs in about 5 minutes, so take that as you will.
